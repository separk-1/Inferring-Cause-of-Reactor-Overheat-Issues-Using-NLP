        "question": "What is reactor core isolation?",
        "answer": "Reactor core isolation is a safety system that removes decay heat after reactor isolation during power operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the main functions of the isolation condenser system?",
        "answer": "The main functions are to remove decay heat, limit reactor pressure, and provide water inventory."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the isolation condenser system operate?",
        "answer": "It operates by natural circulation using high-pressure independent loops."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the pressurizer relief tank?",
        "answer": "The pressurizer relief tank condenses and cools discharge from pressurizer safety and relief valves, preventing environmental hazards."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of high-point vents in the reactor coolant system?",
        "answer": "High-point vents remove noncondensible gases that could inhibit natural circulation and core cooling."
