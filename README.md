## 0. requirements.txt

The project dependencies and required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. This includes necessary Python libraries such as Flask, LangChain, and others for web scraping, RAG, and running the search engine.

## 1. Dataset Collection

This module scrapes safety regulation datasets from the NRC website and saves them into the `./database/manual` folder.

### Scripts:

- **get_dataset.py**:  
  Scrapes the dataset and stores it in `./database/manual`. If any downloads fail, they are logged in `failed_downloads.txt`. The file paths and titles are stored as a dictionary in `file_title.csv`.

- **check_dataset.py**:  
  Verifies if there are any corrupted files within the `./database` folder.

## 2. Running the Search Engine

To launch the search engine, run the `app.py` script. This will start a web server where you can input queries. After hitting enter, the system will retrieve answers along with relevant references.

### Key file:

- **app.py**:  
  Starts the search engine and provides answers to questions based on the dataset, along with references.

## 3. Functions

This section contains two utility modules:

- **functions/functions_rag.py**:  
  Contains core functions related to RAG-based search processes.

- **functions/functions_utils.py**:  
  Includes additional utility functions to support the search engine.

## 4. Static and Templates

The web design (CSS and HTML templates) is stored in the `static` and `templates` folders.
